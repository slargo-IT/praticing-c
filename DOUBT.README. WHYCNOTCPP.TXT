Spend 5 days configuring Unreal Engine Cry Engine Unity to test AAA engines to make 
some AI for a game.

Unreal Engine is a total crap, take 10 to 15 to compile BLANK <code> 
CryEngine is a little bit better on compile, no assets intresting.
Unity is for C# purposes. Not mines.

As i loose some times i realize that only C++ language is support for Unreal & CryEngine.

I don't want to use c++, which appear to be a total waste of time for me, I love the idiomatic C and i will use it. 

So i choose thoses soft and solutions to build my AI API:

OpenCL in C using codeblocks

OpenGL in C using codeblocks

SDL2.0 in C using Codeblocks

SDL1.0 in C using Codeblocks

Tensorflow API in C using gedit or codeblocks
