I don't want to use c++, which appear to be a total waste of time for me. Why ?
Because i want to create AI for Robotic purposes, at this level you need to understand all of
the memory allocation, gesture.

But more : C is way more portable than C++ / OpenCL & OpenGL & are made in C / Git is made in C / Ubuntu as well / ML algo runs way better in C than C++, and IoT machine learning requiered to be portable.

So i choose thoses soft and solutions to build my AI API:

OpenCL in C using codeblocks

OpenGL in C using codeblocks

SDL2.0 in C using Codeblocks

Tensorflow API in C using sublimetext or codeblocks
